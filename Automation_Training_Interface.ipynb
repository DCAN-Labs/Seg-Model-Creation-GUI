    "**Paths** - On launch of the main Ui window, the user will see a list of path arguments that must be filled out that are specific to where their own directories are located. Every user will not be able to access the same files due to permission errors so it is important that the user has their own paths to a SynthSeg directory, Dcan-nn-unet, a Task Folder where all of the data is stored, and their raw data base.\n",

    "    \n",
    "- *Running Inference* - nnUNet inference step, the trained model will create inferred segmentations for your test data and create plots comparing it to the ground truth labels. These will go in your results folder with ###_infer containing the segmentations and ###_results containing the plots.\n"
